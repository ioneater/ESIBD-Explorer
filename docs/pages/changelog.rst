Version 0.7.0 2025-01-19
========================

This version brings multiple improvements to the user interface and messages. The main new features include the Universal Channel Manager (UCM), PID Plugin, and a channel interface for scans. The data and config file formats remain unchanged. The plugin file format is significantly simplified but requires adjustments (see below) to use old plugins with the current version!

Added
~~~~~

- Universal Channel Manager (UCM) plugin: This plugin allows to reference arbitrary channels from other devices to create a central list of the most important information. All referenced channels can be controlled from here. The corresponding display allows to see recorded data from multiple devices in one central location. For most users this should result in improved performance and less complexity as the individual device tabs and corresponding displays will rarely be needed once the channels in the UCM are configured.
- PID Plugin: Allows to establish a PID control loop between two arbitrary channels.
- Added option to collapse channels of same color to focus on the most relevant channels.
- Channels now allow to change Line Style and Group for plotting.
- Channels now allow to change Scaling to highlight important channels (and to see them from the other side of the lab!).
- Added channel interface for scans.
- Depo scan can now record data from arbitrary additional channels.
- Added option to inspect the object currently in the Console input.
- Option to use icons instead of labels in tab bars (active by default).
- Live Displays allow to sort plot curves by device, unit, or group (new channel parameter), and arrange them horizontally, vertically, or stacked.
- Added plugins for KEITHLEY 6487, GAA MIPS, NI9263, Pfeiffer Omnicontrol, RSPD3303C, and pico PT-104.
- Added option to generate plot files for displays including MS, Line, PDB, Holo.
- Plugin Manager now shows the supported version of plugins and highlights if they are compatible with the current program or not.

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Plugin format: Much of the functionally has been moved to the base class allowing developers to use standard functionality by using a flag (useMonitors, useDisplays, useBackgrounds, useOnOffLogic) instead of implementing it in the specific plugin file. Some functions have been renamed to be more descriptive and consistent. Most important examples are: stop -> closeCommunication, init -> initializeCommunication, apply -> applyValues. Make sure to compare to build in examples and test your plugins when updating your custom plugins for the current version. Documentation in CustomDevice has been improved to demonstrate and explain the current plugin format.
- Logging is now enabled by default. More informative status, warning, and error messages. A lot more messages in debug mode.
- Using icons for messages, warnings, and errors in status bar, log file, and Console
- Old logs are regularly removed from the log file
- Reorganized internal device plugins in dedicated folders
- Temporary parameters like monitors or other device states are now saved but not restored.
- Parameters that are undefined before communication to the corresponding device is established are set to NaN to emphasize that there is no up to date value available.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

- Splitting Pressure plugin into dedicated TIC and MAXIGAUGE plugins. If necessary channels can be combined using UCM. Pressure plugin is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

Fixed
~~~~~

- Replaced deprecated :code:`numpy.bool8` with :code:`numpy.bool_`
- Various minor bug fixes

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Various performance improvements
- Improved speed and stability of tests. Time is logged during testing if in debug mode.

Version 0.6.18 2024-06-10
=========================

Added
~~~~~

- Tree.inspect now shows values if applicable
- Console restores history of used commands after restart
- Introduced setDisplayDecimals to customize display of floats including scientific notation
- Added variable aspect ratio option for beam scan (varAxesAspect in autogenerated plot file)
- Added new scan mode "Spectra" for a series of 1D spectra based on Beam scan
- Added new UI tool MultiStateAction
- Added dedicated channelPlot to display channel data instead of using Line plugin
- Added msSpectra mode for simple mass spectra
- Added PluginManager.testing flag to avoid interaction of parallel testing thread with UI dialog boxes leading to rare crash during testing

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Communication has to be stopped before channels can be moved (increase stability)
- Default ini files are scanned for changes when closing and only overwritten if necessary
- Using last 10 s instead of last 10 data points to define background signal
- Scans now respect the subtractBackground states defined by the devices of the relevant channels
- Virtual channels do not need to be active to be included in scans

Fixed
~~~~~

- Update to pyqtgraph==0.13.7 after replacing deprecated api

- Test mode active by default
- Stop all communication and recording from DeviceManager, now requires explicit confirmation
