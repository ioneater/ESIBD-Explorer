REM Start script for windows
REM based on https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/packaging-pyqt5-pyside2-applications-windows-pyinstaller/

do not run this as a script
run individual blocks manually and only proceed if successful
exit

::::::::::::::
REM Formatting
::::::::::::::

use Open Multiple Files extension with **/*.py to open all python files and make sure linter is analyzing all of them

use the following regex to fix common formating errors
REM ,[a-zA-Z0-9_]| \n|\n\n\n|[^'],'| [b-hk-w] |as f:|lambda :|true|false|parameter[\. ,]|channel[\. ,]|setting[\. ,]
REM files to exclude: *.html,*.js,*.css,*.log,*.gitignore,*.bib,*.tex,*.prof,*.rst,*.txt,*.svg,*.sh,LICENSE,Makefile
temporary enable all pylint checking

::::::::::::::
REM Change Log
::::::::::::::
update changelog in changelog.rst (ideally update before each commit)
update change log title with version and release date
Often, writing the change log inspires some last minute changes!
Content: start bullet points with capitals and dot at the end
- hyphens will be replaced by bullet points on github

REM Added 			for new features.
REM Changed 		for changes in existing functionality.
REM Deprecated 		for soon-to-be removed features.
REM Removed 		for now removed features.
REM Fixed 			for any bug fixes.
REM Security 		in case of vulnerabilities.
REM Performance 	for speed improvements
REM Developer Notes separate changed only relevant for developers from other sections

:::::::::::
REM Testing
:::::::::::
Make sure all test pass in development environment
Test with all/no plugins enabled
Test with hardware
Test after running python -m esibd.reset to simulate installation on a PC where it never ran before
Test changing config, plugin, data paths

:::::::::::::::::::::
REM Environment setup
:::::::::::::::::::::

If applicable perform clean install of virtual environment
REM start from ESIBD Explorer folder
cd setup
call create_env.bat REM make sure no other environments (including VSCode) are active during this step
cd ..
call activate esibd

If no change to the environment since last deployment following is sufficient.
call conda update -y -n base -c conda-forge conda

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
REM Bump version
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

use find and replace to manually update all version references
ATTENTION: do not find and replace all, as this will also overwrite the versions in the change log!
REM update version in pyproject.toml
REM update Product Version in EsibdExplorer.ifp in the General tab
REM update PROGRAM_VERSION in config.py
REM if applicable update year in license file
REM update copyright year and release version also in docs/conf.py

REM Note that the program has to access the version during development and after deployment to test for plugin compatibility
REM Neither reading the version from pyproject.toml or from installed package using importlib.metadata.version covers both use cases,
REM requiring to update the version in both files
REM bumpversion / bump-my-version seems overkill

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
REM Sphinx -> read the docs
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

REM use sphinx-quickstart to generate initial configuration
REM then edit docs/conf.py to customize
call rmdir /q /s docs\_build REM delete docs/_build to generate clean documentation
call rmdir /q /s esibd\docs REM delete docs/_build to generate clean documentation
call rm -r docs\_build REM works in powershell
call rm -r esibd\docs REM works in powershell
REM -M coverage
REM update autodoc_mock_imports and correspondingly pyinstaller_hooks
call sphinx-build docs docs\_build
call sphinx-build -vvv docs docs\_build REM use this to debug build errors
REM NOTE disable script blocker to properly test documentation offline
REM offline version for in app documentation (instrument computers often have no internet access)
call xcopy /i /y /e docs\_build esibd\docs
REM call docs\make.bat html

REM python -m esibd.reset  # clear registry settings to emulate fresh install
python -m esibd.explorer
REM activate all plugins for testing!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
REM create offline installer
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
NOTE: it may take a few minutes before the new version will be used by pypi, if in doubt specify version in create_esibd_offline.bat
create_esibd_offline.bat
unpack and test using start_esibd_offline.bat

:::::::::::::::
REM pyinstaller
:::::::::::::::
open CMD in workspace folder
call rmdir /q /s pyinstaller_build
call rmdir /q /s pyinstaller_dist
call rm -r pyinstaller_build
call rm -r pyinstaller_dist
REM make sure both folders have been deleted!
conda activate esibd-offline
pip install pyinstaller
REM Run the following line to create initial spec file and pyinstaller_dist and pyinstaller_build
REM ATTENTION: Check absolute paths in Files, Shortcuts, and Build! relative paths using <InstallPath> did not work
pyinstaller start.py -n "ESIBD Explorer" --noconsole --clean --icon=esibd/media/ESIBD_Explorer.ico --add-data="esibd;esibd" --copy-metadata nidaqmx --noconfirm --additional-hooks-dir=./pyinstaller_hooks --distpath ./pyinstaller_dist --workpath ./pyinstaller_build
REM --noconsole  # console can be useful for debugging. start .exe from command window to keep errors visible after crash
REM --additional-hooks-dir=./pyinstaller_hooks -> add any modules that plugins may require at run time but are not imported at packaging time: e.g. modules only imported in plugins. modules added here should likely also be added to autodoc_mock_imports in docs/conf.py
REM --onefile meant for release to make sure all dependencies are included in the exe but extracting everything from one exe on every start is unacceptably slow. For debugging use --onedir (default) Use this option only when you are sure that it does not limit performance or complicates debugging
REM --copy-metadata nidaqmx is needed to avoid "No package metadata was found for nidaqmx"
REM do not modify spec file, will be overwritten

::::::::::::::::
REM InstallForge
::::::::::::::::

REM Next, create setup.exe using InstallForge
REM use EsibdExplorer.ifp and adjust absolute file paths for dependencies and setup file if applicable and update "Product Version" and update year in license section!
REM files (only change if filepaths have been changed, e.g. when releasing from different computer):
REM pyinstaller_dist\ESIBD Explorer\_internal
REM pyinstaller_dist\ESIBD Explorer\ESIBD Explorer.exe

REM NOTE without certificate users will see "publisher unknown" message during installation. $300 per year for certificate -> only if number of clients increases
REM NOTE https://installforge.net/support1/docs/setting-up-visual-update-express/ -> for small user groups installing from downloaded exe acceptable and less error prone (e.g. if online links should change). If applicable do manual uninstall before installing from exe to get clean installation.

REM rename ESIBD-Explorer-setup.exe to ESIBD-Explorer-setup_v0.8.2.exe in pyinstaller_build

REM Test installation from exe before continuing

::::::::::::::::
REM git release
::::::::::::::::

REM create tag used for releasing exe later
git commit -a -m "Realeasing version v0.8.2"
git tag -a v0.8.2 -m "Realeasing version v0.8.2"
git push origin main --tags REM to include tags (otherwise tags are ignored)

check read the docs build on https://app.readthedocs.org/projects/esibd-explorer/

REM create release on github with changelog based on commits and following sections (have to be signed in!)
REM select tag
REM Title: Version v0.8.2
REM Copy change log from changelog.rst (remove inline icons if applicable)
REM attach ESIBD-Explorer-setup_v0.8.2.exe from pyinstaller_build to release
REM attach ESIBD-Explorer-portable_v0.8.2.tar.gz to release (rename outside of repository to prevent uploading)
REM Source code (zip) and Source code (tar.gz) will be automatically attached, even though they are not visible before clicking on Publish release
